This project was created during the Technigo boot camp.

This weeks project was to build a survey form in React that consists of 3 questions, at least one question should use radio buttons, at least one question should use a select dropdown. When the user presses submit the form should be hidden and they should see a summary of their answers.

To create this I used React state, 'useState'. 

More ideas:
I built this app for mobile, if I had more time I would have made it responsive and aimed for a strech goal to show each question in it's own 'page' with a continue button to progress to the next question.
